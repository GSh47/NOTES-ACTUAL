To find the total energy of the Molecules in the crystal, we can assume that every atom behaves like a Classical harmonic oscillator with a Potential Energy of $\frac 12 k x^2$ where $k$ is a constant. 
Therefore, Total Energy $E=P.E.+K.E.=\sum_{i=1}^{3}(\frac 12 mv_i^2+\frac 12 kx_i^2)$ for 3D.

Applying the equipartition theorem to approximate the average energy per degree of freedom, we get:$$E=3\times \frac 12 k_{B}T+3\times \frac 12 k_{B}T=3k_BT\tag{1}$$
Therefore, for $1mol$ of atoms, $$N_A\times E=3k_{B}TN_A=3(N_Ak_B)T=3RT\tag{2}$$
Hence, Specific heat capacity at a constant volume($C_V$) becomes:$$C_V=\frac{dE}{dT}=3R$$

This law is only valid at Very Hight Temperatures.
