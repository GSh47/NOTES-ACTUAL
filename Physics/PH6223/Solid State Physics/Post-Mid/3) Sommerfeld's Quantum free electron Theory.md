## Assumptions
- Electrons are Fermions and hence obey Fermi-Dirac Statistics, obeying Pauli's Exclusion principle.
- Taking the Crystal to be an infinite potential well, electrons behave as free particles inside the crystal, while Potential becomes infinite outside.

The solution to the Schrodinger's equation for such potentials is given by:$$\psi(x)=Ae^{\pm i\vec k.\vec r}=Ae^{\pm i(k_xx+k_yy+k_zz)}$$ in 3D. Thus the Normalized Wavefunction becomes:$$\psi(x)=\frac 1{\sqrt V}e^{\pm i\vec k.\vec r}$$ with $V\approx L^3$, where $L$ is the edge length of the confining metal cube.
