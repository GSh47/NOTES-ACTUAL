## Assumptions

- ion cores are at rest, and the net Potential on an electron is periodic with periodicity $a$(The lattice constant).
- Consequently, maximum Potential is at the position of positive ions/cores.

 
The Solution of the Schrodinger equation for free particle potentials is given by:$$\psi(x)=Ae^{\pm ikx}$$
which is a plane wave. Now, when we deal with periodic potentials, we need to use the [[4)A Bloch Theorem]].

## Kronig Penney Model
## Assumptions
- Potential of the electrons due to positive charges is taken as a square wave.(Constant maxima at the core location, and $0$ is  at every other place).
