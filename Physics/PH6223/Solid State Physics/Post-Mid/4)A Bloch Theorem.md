For any perfectly periodic Potential $V(x)=V(x+a)$, Bloch Theorem prescribes that the solution of the Schrodinger's equation:$$\frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2}+\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E-V(x))=0$$
is of the form:$$\psi(x)=e^{\pm ikx}u_k(x)$$where $u_k(x)$ is known as the Bloch function, that modulates the exponential term(affects it only at sites where the positive ions reside).
($\psi(\vec r)=e^{\pm ikx}u_{k}(\vec r)$ in 3D, where $\vec r=x\hat i+y\hat j+z\hat k$)
$u_k(x)$ has the same periodicity as $\psi(x)$, i.e. $u_k(x)=u_k(x+a)$


Properties of $u_k(x)$:
1) It does not affect the travelling wave character of $\psi(x)$
2) It is not localized around certain atoms and exists throughout the crysta, allowing the electron's travelling wave behaviour.
3) Chosen such that Probability distribution at $x$ and $x+a$ are the same.
